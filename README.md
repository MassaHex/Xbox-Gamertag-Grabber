# Xbox-Gamertag-Grabber
This is a node.js project that gathers data from https://xboxgamertag.com/ and converts it into usable JSON data. No need to host it go to https://gamertag-info-search.tres3mincraft.repl.co/ and the JSON data can be generated thereby putting ``?username=...`` after the URL for that specific account.
